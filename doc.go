Package echidna provides sub-packages for building robust Go daemons and CLIs

  - observable is an implementation of the [Gang of Four] [observer] pattern, useful in event-driven programs such as GUIs.

  - program builds upon the Github packages [knadh/koanf] and [urfave/cli/v3] to make it extremely simple to use the
    features of those two excellent packages in concert.

  - set defines goroutine-safe methods for manipulating a generic [set] data structure via the standard operations Add, Contains,
    Intersection, Members, String and Union.

  - stack defines goroutine-safe methods for manipulating a generic [stack] data structure via the standard operations IsEmpty,
    Peek, Pop, Push and Size.

  - terminator permits orderly stopping / shutdown of a group of goroutines via methods which mimic a [sync.WaitGroup].
    There is a default [terminator.Terminator] accessible through top level functions (Add, Done, Wait and so on) that call the
    corresponding Terminator methods.

Refer to the documentation for the individual packages for more details.
