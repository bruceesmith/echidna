Package echidna provides sub-packages for building robust Go daemons and CLIs

  - logger supports logging and tracing based on the standard library package slog.

  - program builds upon the Github packages knadh/koanf and urfave/cli/v3 to make it extremely simple to use the
    features of those two excellent packages in concert.

  - set defines goroutine-safe methods for manipulating a generic set data structure via the standard operations Add, Contains,
    Intersection, Members, String and Union.

  - stack defines goroutine-safe methods for manipulating a generic stack data structure via the standard operations IsEmpty,
    Peek, Pop, Pushand Size.

  - terminator permits orderly stopping / shutdown of a group of goroutines via methods which mimic stop of a sync.WaitGroup.
    There is a default Terminator accessible through top level functions (Add, Done, Wait and so on) that call the
    corresponding Terminator methods.

Refer to the documentation for the individual packages for more details.
